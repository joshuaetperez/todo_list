This is a to-do list website, which stores date in localStorage which means that the data is stored on the browser. 

You can add a task by clicking on the "Add Task" tab and filling in the form. The "Group" field can be left empty, which means that the Task will not be assigned to a Group. The "Task Name" and "Group Name" is limited to 50 characters. You can also add a Group by itself by clicking the "Add Group" tab and filling in a Group name.

Press the "Today", "Next 7 Days", or "All Tasks" tab to see a page with the Tasks that belong in the respective category. In the "Next 7 Days" page, Tasks that have a due date of the current day and the six following days are included.

Press the "Groups" tab to see a page with each of the Groups that you have created. Press the Group tab to open its respective task list.

You can press the "Sort Date" text and/or arrow icon to toggle how the Tasks are sorted (ascending/descending by Task due date). You can also click on a Task to cross it out, representing that you have completed the Task. You can remove a Task by clicking on the "X" icon on the right side. Likewise, you can remove a Group by clicking on the trash icon in the "Groups" page.
